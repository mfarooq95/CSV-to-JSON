# CSV-to-JSON
A simple script that parses CSV data to convert to JSON

This script was created to assist with some work. A specific JSON file was required to be utilized, and its data was in the thousands in a CSV file. The script uses pandas to create a dataframe, parse through the given CSV file, and create a list of entries with the json file, formatted specifically, and then writes the data to a file. The script will write two files: the first file will have only the first five entries for review, while the second file will be the completed JSON file.

A simple script to quicken and ease workload.
